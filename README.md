# Accenture TAG Training - Cancer Diagnosis Predictor 

Welcome to the TAG training course! This Git repo contains a starter project ready for you to clone. Over the next five days, we'll build it up to be able to do some cool stuff. The aim is to have an app that can feed data into a program that helps doctors diagnose a persons risk of developing cancer using some machine learning magic next week. By the end of this course, you should have a greater understanding of Git, Java, Angular and some basic DevOps.   

Sounds exciting!

This course is perfect for complete **Java newbie's**. If you have previous experience in development, this will act as a great refresher. If not, we'll get you up to speed on the basics of how a Java app works. Each day you'll perform a number of **tasks** to build the application. Before you start a task, you should watch the **Pluralsight** videos listed to give you a bit of background and help you complete the task. 

Some of the things we'll cover:   

  - Setting up you development environment
  - Working with Git to clone, commit, push and merge
  - Creating classes with variables, methods and other fun stuff in Java
  - Creating a front end for our app in Angular to input data from a users perspective

Lets get started...

## Day 1

### Overview

Some of the tools we'll be using today include:

  - **Git** is used to store our code. When we make a change, we want to commit it to Git so that it is saved somewhere safe. Others can then pull down our code and run or modify it. **Throughout the course, we will be committing our code to our own repository**. To do this, we will create a GitHub account and pull down our skeleton project.
  - **Intellij** is the IDE we will be using to write and run our code. It's easy to use and contains everything we need to create and deploy Java applications.
  - **Java** is the language we use to write our code. It is based around the idea of Objects. In our case, a patient that could potentially have a malignant cancer could be a patient object, with a name, date of birth and gender. 

### Pluralsight

Watch the below videos before you attempt the first task:

* [What is Git] - Overview of what Git is and why we use it
* [Git Hipster Analogy] - Another way to think about version control systems
* [Create a GitHub Account] - Set yourself up with a brand new Github account (If you already have one, great!) 
* [Basic Git Commands] - Set yourself up with a brand new Github account (If you already have one, great!) 
* [What is Java] - Overview of Java
* [JRE & JDK] - A bit more background on Java. Good to know...
* [Creating a Basic Intellij Java Project] - Another nice to know to get you familiar with Intellij. We'll be importing our project however
* [Variables] - Variables are used in all programming languages to store data
* [Classes] - Classes are a how we represent our data.
* [Methods] - These allow us to perform operations on our classes

### Tasks

With the videos watched, we can now move onto the fun part. What we'll be doing today is setting up our development environment, cloning this repo to your local environment and creating a basic Java class.

#### Task 1
1. Setup up Git on your local PC
2. Clone this Git repository to somewhere on your computer
3. Import the project into Intellij
4. Run the app

*Hints*
* You can install [Git for Windows] to use Git... on Windows
* it's a good idea to have a dedicated development folder on your PC. Perhaps C:/development/projects...
* Import the project as a Maven project. We'll come to what Maven is later.

#### Task 2
1. Create a basic class to represent a patient in our project. 
   1. Name
   2. Date of Birth
   3. Gender
2. Create another class to represent a screening
